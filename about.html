<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My Name is Csorba Istvan. I am 30 years old and live in Szeged, Hungary.</p>
<p>I am a team leader at a logistics company. My co-workers are nice people, but I'm looking for a more creative job, that's why I started to learn web development</p>
<p>I am a conscious person and always want to learn new things and have a lot of friends in IT. I guess this is the place where I should start my new career.</p>
